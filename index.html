          Uniqaya’s delivery time usually depends on your location, but most
          orders within India are delivered in 3–7 business days.
          <br /><br />
          Once you place your order, you’ll receive a confirmation with a
          tracking ID so you can monitor your shipment in real time. Metro
          cities often get deliveries faster, sometimes within 2–3 days, while
          remote areas may take a little longer due to courier service
          availability.
          <br /><br />
          Uniqaya also ensures products are packed securely to reach you fresh
          and undamaged, so your skincare arrives ready to use.

          <br /><br />
          This confirmation means your order has been successfully placed and is
          now being processed. For prepaid orders, the confirmation will also
          indicate successful payment, while for COD orders, it confirms that
          your booking is locked in.
          <br /><br />
